Hey, I'm releasing this under the Apache License 2.0.  It was originally going to be a simple app to help a friend; she updated her iOS and it imported like 7000 email addresses into her contacts.  The app deletes any contact having only an email address.  I wrote up the app, and then checked the app store - as you might expect, it turns out that there are a number of apps that accomplish similar goals.  But hey, now I know how to deal with the Address Book API.

Also, it was originally going to allow regex matching of any given field, but accounting for all the fields was going to be a pain, so I didn't.

Anyway, I'm putting this here for others' reference and use.
